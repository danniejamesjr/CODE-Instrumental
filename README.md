# Earsketch

A place to consolidate some simple EarSketch demos I made in the event that I will expand upon or revisit them at a later date. 
Earsketch is a great tool for learning code and producing music. I will attempt to create a instrumental in Logic Pro X using audio files I create in Earsketch.
