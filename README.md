# Earsketch

A place to consolidate some simple EarSketch demos I made in the event that I will expand upon or revisit them at a later date.

## Todo:
- [ ] Watch tutorial course for free on earsketch
- [ ] Create a song or project within Earsketch
- [ ] Make Repository
- [ ] Add some recorded sounds of my own instruments (alto/tenor sax, oboe, English Horn, etc) to use in sketches
- [ ] Use audio files in Logic (digital audio workstation)
